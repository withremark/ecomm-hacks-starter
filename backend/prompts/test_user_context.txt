Design Desires: Warren's Aesthetic Manifesto

  1. The Texture of Memory

  I want a website that feels like something you could hold. Not the cold glass of an iPhone, but the

   matte finish of a Kindle Paperwhite, the grain of a well-used Moleskine, the particular weight of

  a Paperblank notebook that's traveled in your bag for months. There's a reason I like Barbour waxed

   jackets and Dr. Martens Wildhorse leather—they carry history, they age, they remember. The digital

   equivalent isn't minimalism; it's materiality. Film grain, paper texture, the impression that

  something was made rather than generated.

  2. Afternoon Light and the Language of Mood

  Wong Kar Wai taught me that lighting is narrative. I want my website to feel like a specific

  hour—that golden period in a Parisian café around 4pm when the light comes through the window at an

   angle and everything looks like a memory even as it's happening. Not hyper-sharp, not crisp "UI

  design"—impressionist. Rain on glass. Expired film stock. The visual equivalent of that Japanese

  concept of mono no aware, the bittersweet awareness of impermanence. This is a blog, not a

  portfolio. It should feel like someone is remembering rather than presenting.

  3. East Meets West, Everywhere and Nowhere

  I'm Chinese with a European sensibility, or maybe European with a Chinese soul—it depends on the

  day. I grew up between Hong Kong cha chaan tengs and Parisian cafés, between the chaos of the Bund

  and the restraint of a British suit. I want both. The vermillion of a 朱 seal stamp next to

  Mondrian's black lines. The intimacy of a Shanghai jazz club in 1930 and the minimalism of a

  Japanese zen garden. Not fusion in the cheap sense—more like code-switching, the way you speak

  differently to different people but remain yourself.

  4. Structure with a Pulse

  I love Mondrian. I genuinely do—the precision, the confidence of those black lines, the way primary

   colors become sacred within the grid. But I'm also 闷骚, that untranslatable Chinese word for

  someone who appears reserved but burns underneath. So: clean cards, strong structure, intentional

  layout—but something slightly off. One element tilted half a degree. An asymmetric gap. The Duchamp

   humor of putting a urinal in a museum. Bauhaus is too self-important for me, too convinced of its

  own righteousness. I want the grid to breathe, maybe even laugh.

  5. Vermillion and Sea and Smoke

  The palette comes from a photograph I took in Kala—the Mediterranean through a window, turquoise

  water, rust-colored trees, sandy promenade, the suggestion of mountains in haze. Black and white as

   foundation, always. Then vermillion as punctuation, the color of my family seal, the signature at

  the end of a letter. Muted greens and blues for atmosphere—the colors of a rainy afternoon, a

  half-finished cigarette, the cover of a book you've read three times. Nothing too saturated.

  Everything a little faded, like memory, like film, like the light in that café at 4pm.

I like 4pm Paris. What is that specific vibe and color of paris again? 

I like the feeling that it is an artist's drafting table. I like the feeling of a good pencil. Artistic creation. 

I like warm, soft lights. Matte finish to paper.
