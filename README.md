## The Challenge

Build the best ecommerce tool you can with Nano Banana Pro and Gemini 3 Pro. You have 24 hours.

**What you're working with:**

Nano Banana Pro is Google's new image generation model built on Gemini 3 Pro. It's designed for commercial use—product photography, background replacement, virtual try-on, marketing materials. It outputs up to 4K resolution and handles text in multiple languages.

Gemini 3 Pro is Google's most advanced reasoning model. It's multimodal (text, images, video, audio, code), has a 1M token context window, and excels at complex reasoning and agentic tasks.

**Getting Access:**

1. **Set up your Google Cloud billing account**
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) or [Vertex AI](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai)
   - Create or link a Google Cloud project
   - Enable billing (credit card required)
   
2. **Apply your $100 GCP credit**
   - Each team receives $100 in GCP credits
   - Credits will be distributed at the start of the hackathon
   - This covers approximately 745 2K images or 416 4K images

**Pricing:**
- 2K image: $0.134 each
- 4K image: $0.24 each

**Resources:**
- [Nano Banana Pro Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation)
- [Gemini API Docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)
- [Google Cloud Billing Setup](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/create-billing-account)

**What we're looking for:**

1. **Solves a real problem** - Does this address something ecommerce businesses actually struggle with?
2. **Works well** - Is the execution solid? Does it deliver on what it promises?
3. **Creative use of the tools** - Are you using Nano Banana Pro and Gemini 3 Pro in interesting ways?
4. **Glitz, glam, gl-polished user interfaces** ✨ - Because it’s ecommerce, we ascribe a lot of value to excellent user experience. An obvious idea, executed extraordinarily well, in a useful/novel form factor ≥ an ambitious idea that leaves a lot to the imagination.

**A note on obvious ideas:**

Virtual try-on, background replacement, and basic product photography tools are the most straightforward applications of Nano Banana Pro. If you're building one of these, you're competing against what everyone else will think of first. To win with an obvious idea, your execution needs to be exceptional—not just functional, but genuinely better than existing solutions. We're looking for creativity.

Here are the other obvious ones:

**Image generation:**

- Virtual try-on
- Background replacement
- Product photography
- Marketing visuals/ad creative

**Text/chat:**

- Customer service/product guidance chatbot
- Product description generator
- Marketing copy writer
- Review summarizer

Maybe also:

- Visual search (upload image, find similar products)
- Size recommendation tool

You might make one of these more interesting by:

- Combining two or more obvious ideas into a unified experience, e.g. E2E rich marketing campaign generator, deep research for product reviews
- Putting one of these in an interesting form factor, e.g. iOS App Clip, Apple TV app, Web Component, PoS/kiosk

**What you need to deliver:**

- **GitHub repo with your code** - Fork this repository and fill out the submission template below with your project details
- **Live demo** - Hosted URL or demo video showcasing your tool in action
- **Presentation** - You'll present your project to the group at the end of the 24 hours (5-7 minutes)
