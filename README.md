### What We Built
We built **Outfitted**, a personalized ecommerce engine that transforms any brand’s catalog into a user-specific shopping experience using just one photo. Instead of viewing products on models, customers see themselves wearing the clothes in high-quality, structure-preserving visuals that feel native to the brand.

Outfitted combines **Gemini 3 Pro** for catalog understanding, styling logic, and **Nano Banana Pro** for high-fidelity virtual try-on. The output is an interactive, shoppable digital catalog where pages features *you*—with the garment representation.

### How It Works

**Catalog Ingestion (Gemini 3 Pro)**  
Merchants upload product images or URLs. Gemini 3 Pro extracts structured metadata—colors, materials, silhouettes, fit notes, and identifying garment structure for consistent try-on. 

** Digital Twin Onboarding**  
Users upload a single selfie. Gemini validates the image and extracts lighting, tone, and proportion cues to build a “digital twin.” This ensures identity-preserving try-on across all products.

** Virtual Try-On Generation (Gemini → Nano Banana Pipeline)**  
The system can:  
- Replace model faces in catalog photos with the user  
- Or apply standalone garments (e.g., pants on a white background) onto the user image  
Nano Banana preserves facial features, body proportions, and lighting, delivering up to 4K outputs.

**4. Personalized Catalog**  
The final experience is a digital catalog starring the user:  
- Flipbook-style browsing  
- Hover overlays for size, price, and “Add to Cart”  
- Gemini-generated micro-copy and fit recommendations  
- Seamless replacement of catalog visuals with user-specific images  

This creates a high-end, personalized shopping environment—not just a basic try-on preview.
